# odin_recipe
Soooooo I am going to be making a website dedicated to a recipe. So I think I
will just use the cheese burger recipe example I just watched. I am going to
try to use vscode to type it all out but I am not sure exactly what I am
doing with that.... I am not sure what I am doing in general so I will figure
it out on the go.

I am going to try embedding a website, and adding some images, use paragraphs
and try to bold and italicise "important" things. And also will be linking
this readme into it too for funsies.

NMV not going to use vscode because I cant figure it out. So I will just try
to use bash and git commands and see what happens
